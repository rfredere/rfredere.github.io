<!-- sample h1 for COURSE home page -->
<h2><p style="text-align: center;">I, Rebecca A. Frederes agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2025, ITSC 1110, Computer Science Principles with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: Rebecca A. Frederes, 04/16/2025</p></h2>
